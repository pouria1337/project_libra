    <p class="para p-intro">It may not be a comprehensive list, or even a proper list. It may even be a very poorly constructed list. But, it IS mine and, for me, it's the best list in the world. It really is. I've read many books over the years title of some I've completely forgotten. Some, however, have remained in my head. They have left their impressions. Some have even left more than impressions.</p>

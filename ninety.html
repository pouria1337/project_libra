    <p class="para para-intro">
        Opposite to Huxley's book, yet completely similar in theme, 1984 gives the modern reader a sense of confirmation of what they've been suspecting for quite some time. But to the reader's horror, he'll find that as the story goes forward, the things he hears about in the news in real life sounds very similar to the totalitarian measures taken by The Party in the book. A somewhat short novel best suited to the taste of someone who loves to read about dystopian worlds.

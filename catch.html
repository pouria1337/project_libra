        I've lost count the number of times I've read this book. Claimed by the author to not have been intended as a work of dark comedy, it never fails to make you laugh except if you're in the final chapters. If that's the case, you'll be memoised by the masterful creation of bleak atmosphere and be left with the melancholy feeling of a good thing gone bad. Enough spoiling though as the story takes a knife and thrusts it into the chest of the ultimate bureaucracy, aka The Army. If you've ever served in any branch of the Army anywhere in the world, like I have, you'll find yourself not only enjoy reading it but also coming back to it over the years.

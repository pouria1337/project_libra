    <h1 class="heading">A Brave New World</h1>
    <h2 class="subheading1">By Aldous Huxley</h2>

    <p class="para para-intro">
        A book necessary for reading by anyone who wishes to become conscious of the modern world, more specifically the post-911 era. I'm not suggesting that it talks about the horrors of surveillance, quite the contrary, it doesn't mention anything about surveillance at all. This books digs at humans and how they are conditioned to accept their fate in a world where Rulers determine if you'll even have consciousness or not. A cold calculated atmosphere accompanied by detailed matter-of-fact description of how things are or how thing are created in that world. It's enough to read the first few paragraphs in the story to get hooked.
